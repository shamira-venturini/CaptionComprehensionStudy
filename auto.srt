1
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,680
so is there any way to prove that

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,480
pigeons never existed

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,980
or can be only not be proven to exist

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,180
it's actually I think these question

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,310
hinges on the only way you live and what

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,930
you mean by pigeons what is meant by

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,650
pigeons

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,140
right so today it's going to decide

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,240
pigeons which is to say that there are

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,550
these systems of commissions which are

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,529
created when people come from different

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,659
language background and they have to

13
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:31,740
communicate they have to speak to each

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,760
other so like in Africa in in Asia in

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,330
fact when pidgin arose in the coast of

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,960
China and it referred to this business

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,630
language that people used to cross

18
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,460
linguistic barriers so from that

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,100
perspective pigeons do exist right if

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,980
you take it as the definition pigeons

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,010
have been documented over and over again

22
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,530
there are no native languages and

23
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,630
typically they are indeed reduce in

24
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,570
instructure but as people use them more

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:03,900
and more

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,479
you know they can they can develop

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:18,929
structure so right so so this is what we

28
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,609
need to be clear about how we define

29
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,740
pigeons right because we looked at the

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,170
way Bickerton defined it right so the

31
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,869
claim was a very strong one that in the

32
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,369
history of creole you have this earlier

33
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:34,979
speech system that extremely meat using

34
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,350
structure and it was very precise in

35
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,090
terms of what's missing and what's

36
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,490
missing is a fixes so no no bits of

37
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,380
words that can be used to create larger

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,780
words so you don't have things like in

39
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,859
in English finger right so that's a very

40
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,780
extremely precise claims that claim

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,909
according to which pigeons are supposed

42
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,420
to be had to have the no bottom level of

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,700
language complexity they are really

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,359
simply system possible in fact even an

45
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,310
language like they might remind a say of

46
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,880
a language of Homo erectus

47
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,739
so that that that claim is a strong one

48
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,030
that we're looking at so in the

49
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,200
innovation Creole

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,830
according to the evidence that we have

51
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,410
we don't see any thing of that sort as

52
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,720
documented so the earliest archival data

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,910
shows that we have a full fledge

54
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,740
language with all the bells and whistles

55
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,940
including affixes embedding a very

56
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,310
complex language you know from the very

57
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,620
earliest stages you see we get you seem

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:52,230
to have some doubts about like like we

59
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,580
can know if there was no recording of

60
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,750
there being a pigeon like we like if

61
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,650
there is a recording okay just because

62
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,060
there's no recording can we not say that

63
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,980
oh maybe that was like spoken one right

64
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,430
but it was never yeah I can see what you

65
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:26,610
like you thank you drive that well you

66
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,170
could say that okay so actually bigger -

67
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,760
let's use something of that that kind of

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,890
argument well the way put it I put it

69
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,860
very subtly since that the absence of

70
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,320
evidence is not evidence of absence

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,760
right which is exactly are you trying to

72
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,980
claim here the fella could have

73
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,230
particular kind of data is that evidence

74
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,209
that didn't exist it might have existed

75
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,720
but money recorded it okay but in this

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,090
you know you're right the claim is

77
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,590
stronger that it you know it's a back if

78
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,090
it could have existed in the body could

79
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,560
be attention because it could have

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,290
existed and be part of a community to

81
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,420
the to the point where children being

82
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,070
born in the community would have used

83
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,610
that evidence to create the Creole right

84
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,920
remember that this is what you what you

85
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,340
get you have at some point it's let's

86
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,560
call it generation let's call it zero

87
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,690
okay and for that generation all the

88
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,160
hearing is I think I'm going to have to

89
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,890
use a stronger market Rachel will you

90
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,240
help me with this one with might work

91
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:42,169
oh yeah okay so so so there would have

92
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:46,069
been enough of this kind of data for

93
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:48,740
these children then to use that and then

94
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,160
from that create the Creole right so

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,050
it's not as if that this would have been

96
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,169
a very fleeting type of language so

97
00:04:57,169 --> 00:04:59,539
given that they were they were observers

98
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:02,870
of the speech patterns that period

99
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,000
people wrote about the patterns of the

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,669
of the Africans you see it would have

101
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:10,009
been surprising if it was indeed

102
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,120
communal lingua franca of sorts and

103
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,220
nobody noticed that well there was the

104
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,229
system where all the French officials

105
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,870
were gone you see what one could could

106
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,180
could could imagine along your line or

107
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,310
since that maybe the men have been some

108
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,110
Africans who who will be producing

109
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,300
something that could be pigeon light

110
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,220
which would which would be like a second

111
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,750
language version of French which is what

112
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,460
we expect right because if you if you

113
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:34,940
learning

114
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,949
I don't know Italian you might go to a

115
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,360
state where you put use Italian verbs

116
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,690
without affixes right it forgotten

117
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,430
perspective yes one could imagine that

118
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,430
there would be some speakers producing

119
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,690
pidgin like data right but could there

120
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,729
be a whole community that will be using

121
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,099
the pigeon including say people in in

122
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,930
their own homes to the point where the

123
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,000
children would be only getting because

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,990
remember that for Bickerton

125
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,719
you know the crucial 50s is that you

126
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:06,409
have children here you see and the

127
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,210
children are transforming this pigeon

128
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,639
into a Creole and then you get at a

129
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,770
later generation this is called the

130
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,919
Serrano well plus one oh then you get

131
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,830
the creole becoming a stable language

132
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,729
from the pigeon

133
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,180
people sighs would it be then like

134
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,910
people are keeping their languages being

135
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:38,900
developed at the same time what people

136
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,780
keep in their African languages yeah in

137
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,940
fact the days report so someone actors

138
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,590
Olivia trio for example you know the

139
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,050
well-known Haitian leader was claimed to

140
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,660
also speak African languages from say

141
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,420
the bay family right so this is this is

142
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,460
likely that one could imagine that at

143
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,500
some point there will be many speakers

144
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,900
in the community would be bilingual or

145
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,890
trilingual even speaking foreign

146
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,430
languages but the question here is

147
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,680
whether there was anything like when

148
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,050
Bickerton posits that was spoken across

149
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,310
community to the point where the

150
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,920
children had no choice but to use only

151
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,590
this speech and data to create the

152
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,330
native Creole and the evidence is not

153
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,190
there and also structurally and this is

154
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,160
what we see so maybe we should come back

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,390
that question when we look at the data

156
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,710
because going to come back to the data

157
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,110
that we have and try to make sense of

158
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,480
this thing if you think about the

159
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,130
situation with Spanish there with

160
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,440
English in the u.s. it's very I mean I

161
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,820
wouldn't I would say that there's

162
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,140
several generations that speak it I also

163
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,480
would say that it's relatively unstable

164
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,480
in the way that a pidgin might be but I

165
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,220
also wouldn't know what the difference

166
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,410
would be between an unstable pidgin and

167
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,160
code switching in the sense that like if

168
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,870
you think about more of a modern-day

169
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,630
example I would say that Spanglish is

170
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,170
the best candidate but that also is my a

171
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,300
that would Tingley should be anything

172
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,660
like a pigeon right and in first of all

173
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,210
I would say that the conditions that

174
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,190
surround Spanglish are very different

175
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,650
from those that surrounded say the

176
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,020
creation of the haitian creole so in

177
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,450
terms of justin mix you see so in

178
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,590
Haitian Creole devastation will have

179
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,590
lots of Afghani which is being spoken

180
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,660
and plus many varieties of French

181
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,440
doesn't just want french were many

182
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,760
languages that for now called French but

183
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,419
in fact they were quite different in

184
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,130
the structure what the French themselves

185
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:48,150
called the path one right looking at

186
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,340
that definition then technically the

187
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,950
only pigeons would be the very very

188
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,740
first languages like so then like you

189
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,460
can't have Creole be a pigeon because it

190
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,860
influenced well that's what we're going

191
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,350
to see exactly that that in a way there

192
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,530
is a sense in which you know by by using

193
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,930
that because it's that close right from

194
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,050
pigeons you're really creasing bias

195
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,910
against the idea that you know the the

196
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,190
Africans actually they were learning

197
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,270
French in the same way say that the

198
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,610
French people themselves in Europe back

199
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,930
when French was being created we're

200
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,580
learning Latin and in fact we went to

201
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,620
look at some data like that ok so let's

202
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,600
so this is this is all good so you guys

203
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,250
have been I've been asking all the right

204
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,310
questions
