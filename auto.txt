so is there any way to prove that

pigeons never existed

or can be only not be proven to exist

it's actually I think these question

hinges on the only way you live and what

you mean by pigeons what is meant by

pigeons

right so today it's going to decide

pigeons which is to say that there are

these systems of commissions which are

created when people come from different

language background and they have to

communicate they have to speak to each

other so like in Africa in in Asia in

fact when pidgin arose in the coast of

China and it referred to this business

language that people used to cross

linguistic barriers so from that

perspective pigeons do exist right if

you take it as the definition pigeons

have been documented over and over again

there are no native languages and

typically they are indeed reduce in

instructure but as people use them more

and more

you know they can they can develop

structure so right so so this is what we

need to be clear about how we define

pigeons right because we looked at the

way Bickerton defined it right so the

claim was a very strong one that in the

history of creole you have this earlier

speech system that extremely meat using

structure and it was very precise in

terms of what's missing and what's

missing is a fixes so no no bits of

words that can be used to create larger

words so you don't have things like in

in English finger right so that's a very

extremely precise claims that claim

according to which pigeons are supposed

to be had to have the no bottom level of

language complexity they are really

simply system possible in fact even an

language like they might remind a say of

a language of Homo erectus

so that that that claim is a strong one

that we're looking at so in the

innovation Creole

according to the evidence that we have

we don't see any thing of that sort as

documented so the earliest archival data

shows that we have a full fledge

language with all the bells and whistles

including affixes embedding a very

complex language you know from the very

earliest stages you see we get you seem

to have some doubts about like like we

can know if there was no recording of

there being a pigeon like we like if

there is a recording okay just because

there's no recording can we not say that

oh maybe that was like spoken one right

but it was never yeah I can see what you

like you thank you drive that well you

could say that okay so actually bigger -

let's use something of that that kind of

argument well the way put it I put it

very subtly since that the absence of

evidence is not evidence of absence

right which is exactly are you trying to

claim here the fella could have

particular kind of data is that evidence

that didn't exist it might have existed

but money recorded it okay but in this

you know you're right the claim is

stronger that it you know it's a back if

it could have existed in the body could

be attention because it could have

existed and be part of a community to

the to the point where children being

born in the community would have used

that evidence to create the Creole right

remember that this is what you what you

get you have at some point it's let's

call it generation let's call it zero

okay and for that generation all the

hearing is I think I'm going to have to

use a stronger market Rachel will you

help me with this one with might work

oh yeah okay so so so there would have

been enough of this kind of data for

these children then to use that and then

from that create the Creole right so

it's not as if that this would have been

a very fleeting type of language so

given that they were they were observers

of the speech patterns that period

people wrote about the patterns of the

of the Africans you see it would have

been surprising if it was indeed

communal lingua franca of sorts and

nobody noticed that well there was the

system where all the French officials

were gone you see what one could could

could could imagine along your line or

since that maybe the men have been some

Africans who who will be producing

something that could be pigeon light

which would which would be like a second

language version of French which is what

we expect right because if you if you

learning

I don't know Italian you might go to a

state where you put use Italian verbs

without affixes right it forgotten

perspective yes one could imagine that

there would be some speakers producing

pidgin like data right but could there

be a whole community that will be using

the pigeon including say people in in

their own homes to the point where the

children would be only getting because

remember that for Bickerton

you know the crucial 50s is that you

have children here you see and the

children are transforming this pigeon

into a Creole and then you get at a

later generation this is called the

Serrano well plus one oh then you get

the creole becoming a stable language

from the pigeon

people sighs would it be then like

people are keeping their languages being

developed at the same time what people

keep in their African languages yeah in

fact the days report so someone actors

Olivia trio for example you know the

well-known Haitian leader was claimed to

also speak African languages from say

the bay family right so this is this is

likely that one could imagine that at

some point there will be many speakers

in the community would be bilingual or

trilingual even speaking foreign

languages but the question here is

whether there was anything like when

Bickerton posits that was spoken across

community to the point where the

children had no choice but to use only

this speech and data to create the

native Creole and the evidence is not

there and also structurally and this is

what we see so maybe we should come back

that question when we look at the data

because going to come back to the data

that we have and try to make sense of

this thing if you think about the

situation with Spanish there with

English in the u.s. it's very I mean I

wouldn't I would say that there's

several generations that speak it I also

would say that it's relatively unstable

in the way that a pidgin might be but I

also wouldn't know what the difference

would be between an unstable pidgin and

code switching in the sense that like if

you think about more of a modern-day

example I would say that Spanglish is

the best candidate but that also is my a

that would Tingley should be anything

like a pigeon right and in first of all

I would say that the conditions that

surround Spanglish are very different

from those that surrounded say the

creation of the haitian creole so in

terms of justin mix you see so in

Haitian Creole devastation will have

lots of Afghani which is being spoken

and plus many varieties of French

doesn't just want french were many

languages that for now called French but

in fact they were quite different in

the structure what the French themselves

called the path one right looking at

that definition then technically the

only pigeons would be the very very

first languages like so then like you

can't have Creole be a pigeon because it

influenced well that's what we're going

to see exactly that that in a way there

is a sense in which you know by by using

that because it's that close right from

pigeons you're really creasing bias

against the idea that you know the the

Africans actually they were learning

French in the same way say that the

French people themselves in Europe back

when French was being created we're

learning Latin and in fact we went to

look at some data like that ok so let's

so this is this is all good so you guys

have been I've been asking all the right

questions
